# Simple Industrial Network Templates
M.Sc. Minh-Hoang Ngo, Hochschule Karlsruhe, DE.<br /><br />
Here I upload some simple templates for the Industrial-Network course that I taught since 2018.<br />
These templates are used to build the complete projects according to the Lab-Handbooks and Theoretical-Books.<br />
Hope you could find them interesting. Have a nice day!<br />
